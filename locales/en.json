  ".aboutus": {
    "title": "About us",
    "text1": "We are regularly asked how my wife and I ended up in Brittany.",
    "text2": "That story begins around 2017, when we decided to go to South America and do a road trip through Chile and Argentina. We rented a worn down 'fourgon', threw a tent in the back and hit the road. We both had frantic lives, living and working in Belgium, so to minimize the stress we had quite meticulously planned our voyage. On day 2 that plan was already shot. We decided to let go and just take it as it comes. That was my first lesson learned.",
    "text3": "We stayed either on campsites or in Airbnbs at people's homes and got to meet the most heartwarming friendly people , who lived the simple life out in the country and shared everything they've got. It started to dawn on me, that these people where much happier than what I was used to in Europe.  What they lacked in material well-being was compensated by something else. Pure unspoilt nature, social coherence, Joi de vivre, real ecologie, stuff that matters. That was my second lesson learned.",
    "text4": "We ended up on a campsite in Patagonia, owned by Nacho, who gave me my biggest life lesson. Nacho used to be a roadie, touring half the world for most of his adolescent life. That changed when he and his Chilean wife, found a magical plot of land by the Rio Simpson, started farming lettuce and opened a campsite and focused on the important stuff, meeting people and living out in nature. After an epic guitar jam session with him, he gave me an equally epic piece of advise: Don't wait. If you want to change your life, do it now. And we did !",
    "text5": "Back home we sold our house, quit our jobs and hit the road again, but this time with a clear goal. Change our lives, do it now ! We searched for our dream house and when we stumbled upon this 300 year old farmhouse by the sea overlooking brittanies most beautiful archipelo, it was love at first sight. Over the course of the past years we've renovated this magical place, respecting the history and ecology of the building , to let people enjoy with us what we find important: the Simple Life, nature, good food and conversations."
